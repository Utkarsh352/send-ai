**Tagline:** Why wait until month-end? Access your earned wages instantly with crypto-powered payroll.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**The Market Gap:** Employees work every day but only get paid monthly, creating cash flow problems and limiting financial flexibility. Traditional payroll systems force workers to wait 30+ days for money they've already earned.

**Our Solution:** Real-time wage access through cryptocurrency payments via Yellow Network, allowing employees to claim their earnings as they work.
